## Course Description

This course will provide in-depth, hands-on experience with administration of Linux-based
operating systems, including installation, configuration, and documentation of system
components. Topics covered will span aspects of security, access, authentication,
and network setup and troubleshooting, as well as the automation thereof. The primary
objective is to provide fluency in practical administration and system design strategies
in the IT industry.

## Pre-requisites

### Courses

- CSC 160 Computing Technologies

### Reading

This course is intended for students with a basic knowledge of Linux and its most
common utilities and text editors. For students with no prior experience watch the
free [‘Introduction to Linux’](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-1)
online course.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the course the student will be fluent in the automation of Linux system
configuration, as well as the troubleshooting of Linux application and networking
issues. They will understand Linux design concepts such as network protocols, security,
and other associated technologies. The student will be prepared with the tools and
concepts needed to efficiently build and manage an enterprise Linux infrastructure.
They will be able to apply this foundation of knowledge and hands on experience to
the obtaining of a profession in the IT industry. The application of administration
theory and experience through hands-on lab exercises creates a foundation of the
skills required in any computer science degree and profession. The results should
include actual job skills that can translate into employment opportunities including
Linux system administration.

## Methods of Assessment

Assessment will be based on classroom participation in discussions of the technologies
and techniques covered, completing and delivering the lab exercises, the research
paper, and the final project. There will be no formal tests for this course.

## Attendance Policy

Class attendance is not necessarily mandatory, but it is **strongly encouraged,**
as in I cannot encourage it strongly enough. The deliverables can be completed
without attendance, and all of the information you need to build these skills is
freely available, but the discussions held in class offer perspective, context,
and targeted assistance that is unavailable in individual study. It is expected
that each student in attendance be prepared to contribute to the class discussion
and on any group project(s). All scheduled classes offer points that can help augment
some of the more difficult portions of the class. As such, when you are absent
your "Participation” grade will be reduced.

## Late Submission Policy

Late work affects timely feedback in class and entry of grades at St. Martin’s University.
As such the instructor retains total discretion to award either full, or partial
or “no” credit for work/tests that are submitted late with no notice from the student.
Students who do not communicate with the instructor about late submissions will
see no grade in the Moodle book for a time – usually two weeks. After that, the
instructor normally enters “zero points” in the Moodle gradebook, and except in
very special circumstances, points that are entered in the Moodle gradebook are
final.

## Administrative Requirements

### Disabilities Support Service Explanation

Access/Disability Services:  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) mandates colleges and universities
to provide "reasonable accommodation" to any enrolled student with a disability.
The law protects the student's rights to have an equalized opportunity for learning
and for participating in campus programs and activities.  Students have the right
to services and reasonable accommodations providing they meet the basic requirements
to perform activities of the program.  Saint Martin's University Student Services
includes a Disability Support Services office which works with students and potential
students.  We arrange those accommodations that allow our students to participate
in classes and activities and have equal access to a full education here at the
university alongside their fellow students, in whatever format the class is offered.
Students with medically recognized and documented (permanent or temporary) disabilities
and who are in need of accommodation have an obligation to notify the University
of their needs.  If you need accommodations because of a disability, if you have
emergency medical information that would be helpful for me to know, or if you need
special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please let me know.

### Academic Dishonesty Policy

Saint Martin's University and your instructor appreciate integrity and honesty.
Please use your own thoughts, words, and ideas for your assignments. PLAGIARISM
will NOT be tolerated.  If quoting from the work of another author, please give
credit by acknowledging it in your paper using quotation marks and citing the information
sources. For example:  "direct quote (Author’s last name, 2019, page number)". When
paraphrasing (or rephrasing) the work of another author, acknowledge by citing the
information source.  For example:  paraphrased comments (Author’s last name, 2019)

Academic dishonesty consists of any of the following acts:  Assisting another student
on examinations, tests, quizzes or other assignments, or receiving assistance from
a student without permission of the instructor.  Using unauthorized materials for
assistance during examinations, tests or quizzes or other assignments.

#### Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the act of using the words and ideas of others without giving proper
credit. Common varieties of plagiarism include:

- Having another individual write a paper or take an examination for a student
- Directly quoting material without using quotation marks or proper indentation
- Not giving credit for another person's original ideas and organization
  - See page 60-61 of the 2019-2020 undergraduate academic catalog

Plagiarism and cheating are considered unethical actions and a violation of academic
policy. The procedures for dealing with these cases are outlined in the Saint Martin's
University Student Handbook.

### Request for an Incomplete Grade

The grade of "I" means incomplete and is given for work, which is of passing quality
but which, because of circumstances beyond the student's control, is not complete.
A student must request an incomplete grade in writing prior to the last week of
the semester.  The request must be submitted on the University “I” Grade request
Form to the course instructor and must specify the reason for the request. The issuance
of the grade of “I” is at the discretion of the faculty member teaching the course.
Instructors may grant “I” grades to students as long as 50% of the course work has
been completed and the student has a justifiable cause such as deployment, illness,
family emergency, etc.  The approved “I” Grade Request Form must include specific
work required to remove the incomplete.  If the instructor approves, the Office
of the Registrar must receive a copy of the [“I” Grade Request Form](https://www.stmartin.edu/forms?topic=Registrar)

#### Removal of an Incomplete Grade

The removal of an "I" grade is the student's responsibility. All coursework must
be completed according to the terms agreed to on the “I” Grade Request Form. An
“I” grade will remain on the student's transcript for one (1) regular semester
(Fall or Spring) beyond the semester in which the "I" was entered.  At the conclusion
of that one semester, the grade of “I” will be converted into a grade of "F" unless
the instructor has submitted a grade change.
