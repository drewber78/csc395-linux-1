# Week 7

## "Distro Fever"

The landscape can seem vast and complex when attempting to select a Linux distribution
that is fit for a particular purpose or use case. Users often start with simplified,
all-in-one systems intended for Day Zero desktop readiness, even going so far as
to emulate the user experience of WIdely kNown DesktOp WorkStation operating systems
that users may be more familiar with (not to name any names) so as to ease the transition
for first time linux users. These are perfectly suitable for what many home/business
desktop users need: a browser, document editors, and emails. When their needs begin
to extend into other areas, whatever those may be, many users seek out more unique
distributions that are more specialized for these purposes. Distributions can be
optimized for performance and minimalism for customization and hosting of other
tooling, or they can come pre-packed with all the packages and configurations for
an incredibly specific use case. Regardless of your needs, there is almost always
a distribution out there that will at least provide a good starting point on which
to build your system. When selecting one to use yourself, explore all the [options](https://distrowatch.com/)
then, if all else fails, [build your own!](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/diy-build-custom-minimal-linux-distribution-source)

## Research Paper

To provide a reprieve from editing YAML files, your exercise this week is to write
a research paper on a Linux distribution of your choice. Please use the information
below as your guide in doing so and submit the paper via Moodle by the listed date.

- Select 1 distribution from [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/) or the list
  compiled by [LWN.net](https://lwn.net/Distributions/)
  - Feel free to get creative, but please avoid [obvious novelty distributions](http://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/)
- Make your distribution choice known so we can avoid duplicates
- Write a research paper discussing the details of the distro, such as:
  - Basics
    - Development/release model
    - Support model
    - Backing (individual(s), community organization, company, etc.)
  - Target audience
    - Who is this distribution made for?
    - How is it marketed to these users?
  - Unique features/advantages for the target users
    - What would make a user switch from another distro to this one?
    - What would the target users appreciate about this distro?
  - History (but please don't make it a "History of {distro}" paper)
- Details:
  - 3-5 pages long
  - Double spaced
  - 12pt TNR or similar (I don't really care, just no clown fonts or sizes)
  - APA Formatting
    - Heading
    - Numbers
    - Stylings
    - Citations
      - I assume that your paper will include factual information from outside
        sources based on the requirements. Just use at least one and cite as necessary.

**Note**: This isn't an English class, but good writing is important for everyone.
I won't be grading on style or voice, but I will deduct points for easy stuff like
punctuation, formatting, grammar, etc. so please proofread your work before submitting.
