# Week 8

## Our Final Week

Continue work on your exercises from Week 7 and prepare a short summary presentation
of the functions of your lab. You should showcase the following functions:

- A clean run of your `configuration` playbook without any skipped sections
  - Include any playbooks you used to administer the below functions; the `provisioning`
    playbook need not be run in the demonstration
- Internal DNS Resolution via Host1
- A mounted Samba share accessible by at least your admin user
- A website visible from inside the network
- A VPN that allows outside users to connect to the network

### System Presentation

Your group will give a presentation comprised of a system overview (components, features,
etc.) as well as a review of your experience configuring it (roadblocks, breakthroughs,
etc.) to the instructor. Although your systems will be very similar, based on the
nature of our exercises, the pathways and techniques you used to get there,
as well as your reflection on the experience, should be unique. This should take
about 5-10 minutes and will be given during the last instruction time slot. Your
group need not create any formal deliverables for this presentation (PPT, etc.)
but be prepared to show your screen for discussion of your materials and lab functions.
